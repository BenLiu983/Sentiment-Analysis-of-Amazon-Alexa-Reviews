# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Alexa-Reviews

# Introduction
Background: The public relations department team has collected extensive data on their customers such as product reviews. Based on the reviews ( in text format), the team would like to predict whether their customers are satisfied with the product or not. 

Data: The dataset consists 3150 Amazon customers reviews for Alexa Echo, Firestick, Echo Dot etc.

# Methodology
Since this is a binary classification problem, I applied two classic NLP models, Naive Bayes classification and logistic classification. The primary metric would be the accuracy.

# EDA

The dataset includes 3150 rows and 5 columns, while the last column is the response variable. (Note: 1 indicates positive feedback)

As for the distribution of the feedbacks, most of them are positive feedbacks.
